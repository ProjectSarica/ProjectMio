## Getting Started

Project Mio is designed as an interface library. In production, it simply acts as a passthrough interface to allow for the decision making processes to easily connect to Minecraft API without targeting it directly. This makes the process extremely easy to mock in unit testing environments. As such, this library also provides a series of tools and utilities for making the testing process much eaiser.
